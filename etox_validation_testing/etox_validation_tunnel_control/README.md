# Validation

Validation of the beecs implementation against the original BEEHAVE_ecotox model.

The plots below show simulation results for one year. Lines are medians of 100 simulations, areas are 5% and 95% quantiles.

This test uses 12 hour days all around the year ("Tunnel 12h") to check if the colony dynamics run the same way under ideal circumstances. There are slight differences in the colony dynamics and foraging behaviour. beecs seems to "run faster", meaning that it reaches maximum honeystores and peaks in population slightly before BEEHAVE does. This causes some differences in PPP exposure as well, because the number of foragers on the day of application is hugely relevant for the simulations. 

Still have to debug where the difference in all behaviours are caused.

## Colony structure

- gonna find out how to put plots here to show similarities once I actually make this repo public in one way or another


## Honey and pollen stores

- gonna find out how to put plots here to show similarities once I actually make this repo public in one way or another
