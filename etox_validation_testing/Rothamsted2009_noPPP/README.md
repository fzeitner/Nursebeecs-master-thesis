# Validation

Validation of the beecs implementation against the original BEEHAVE_ecotox model.

The plots below show simulation results for one year. Lines are medians of 100 simulations, areas are 5% and 95% quantiles.

This test uses the wheather from Rothamsted (2009) to explore the effects of fenoxycarb. The weather setting can be adequately simulated as is evident in test "Rothamsted2009_noPPP". 


## Colony structure

- gonna find out how to put plots here to show similarities once I actually make this repo public in one way or another


## Honey and pollen stores

- gonna find out how to put plots here to show similarities once I actually make this repo public in one way or another
