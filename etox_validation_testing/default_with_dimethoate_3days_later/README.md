# Validation

Validation of the beecs implementation against the original BEEHAVE_ecotox model.

The plots below show simulation results for one year. Lines are medians of 100 simulations, areas are 5% and 95% quantiles.

There are close to no differences without PPP-exposure turned on and some rather drastic differences in forager mortality with PPP-exposure of dimethoate. However, these differences seem to take roots in the slight differences in foraging behaviour, as for some reason less foragers actually go to forage in the beecs version on the application day.

In this test (default with dimethoate 3 days later) one can see that the colony dynamics are basically identical with a simple shift of 3 days, because on this day all foragers come into contact with the PPP from foraging on the application day. The logic behind PPP exposure and effect seem to work the same way as in BEEHAVE already.

Still have to debug where the difference in foraging behaviour is caused.

## Colony structure

- gonna find out how to put plots here to show similarities once I actually make this repo public in one way or another


## Honey and pollen stores

- gonna find out how to put plots here to show similarities once I actually make this repo public in one way or another
