// Here new IHbees and drone cohorts get initialized each tick.
// The process had to be decoupled this from the other systems to get closer to original BEEHAVE,
// because the devs decided to have Broodcare happen after ageing of cohorts and thus calculating new Ihbees/Drones,
// but before actually initializing them as new cohorts and having them counted to the total (for broodcare or other processes).
// Overall somewhat of a small difference, but it is noticable in quantitative model behaviour, especially for brood.
